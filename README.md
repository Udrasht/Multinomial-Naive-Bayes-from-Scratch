# SMAI-Mini-Project-1
Classify the message is spam or not using Multinomial Naive Bayes.

## Introduction
This question will have you working and experimenting with the Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes classifier. Initially, you will transform the given data in csv file to count matrix, then calculate the priors. Use those priors to compute likelyhoods according to Multinomial Naive Bayes and then classify the test data. Please note that use of `sklearn` implementations is only for the final question of the assignment, for other doubts regarding libraries you can reach out to the TAs.

The dataset is about `Spam SMS`. There is 1 attribute that is the `message`, and the class label which could be `spam` or `ham`. The data is present in `spam.csv`. It contains about 5-6000 samples.
For your convinience the data is already pre-processed and loaded, but I suggest you to just take a look at the code for your own knowledge, and parts vectorization is left up to you which could be easily done with the help of the given example code.
